# Transcription-Usage Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful integration of the video transcription processing pipeline with the usage tracking system for CantoneseScribe Pro. This integration completes the MVP requirements for a production-ready transcription service with comprehensive usage monitoring and billing.

## Integration Components Completed

### 1. Schema Updates ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `/api/app/schemas/transcription.py`
- `/api/app/schemas/files.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `usage_info` field to `TranscriptionResponse`
- Added `usage_info` field to `TranscriptionJob`
- Added `usage_info` field to `FileUploadResponse`

These fields provide real-time usage information in API responses, allowing the frontend to display current usage status and warnings.

### 2. File Upload Integration ✅

**File Modified:**
- `/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/files.py`

**Key Features:**
- **Pre-upload validation**: Checks usage limits before allowing file uploads
- **File size validation**: Enforces plan-specific file size limits
- **Duration estimation**: Uses file size to estimate processing requirements
- **Usage warnings**: Provides alerts when approaching limits
- **Detailed error responses**: Clear error messages with upgrade prompts

**Flow:**
1. User uploads file
2. System estimates duration and credits required
3. Checks against user's current plan limits
4. Blocks upload if limits exceeded with detailed error message
5. Includes usage information in successful upload response

### 3. Transcription Service Enhancement ✅

**File Modified:**
- `/api/app/services/transcription_service.py`

**New Features:**
- **get_file_info() method**: Provides accurate file information for usage estimation
- **Enhanced process_job() method**: Integrates with usage tracking throughout the pipeline
- **Real-time usage recording**: Records actual usage based on processed audio duration
- **Failure handling**: Proper error handling with usage context
- **Cost calculation**: Accurate cost tracking based on actual processing time

**Processing Flow:**
1. Job created with estimated usage
2. Actual file metadata extracted
3. Real usage recorded based on actual duration
4. Processing proceeds with usage context
5. Final job includes complete usage information

### 4. Usage-Aware API Endpoints ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/transcription.py`

**Enhanced Endpoints:**
- **POST /transcription/check-limits**: Pre-processing usage validation
- **POST /transcription/start**: Integrated usage checks and recording
- **GET /transcription/status/{job_id}**: Includes current usage information
- **GET /transcription/jobs**: Usage context for job listings
- **POST /transcription/export**: Usage tracking for exports

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive limit checking before processing
- Real-time usage information in all responses
- Graceful error handling with usage context
- Upgrade prompts when limits approached

### 5. Error Handling & User Experience ✅

**Error Scenarios Handled:**
- **Insufficient credits**: Clear messaging with exact requirements
- **File size exceeded**: Plan-specific limit information
- **Concurrent processing limits**: Queue status and wait times
- **Usage service failures**: Graceful degradation

**User Experience Features:**
- **Usage warnings**: Proactive alerts before hitting limits
- **Upgrade prompts**: Direct links to pricing when limits exceeded
- **Real-time feedback**: Current usage status in all responses
- **Processing context**: Usage information during job processing

## API Integration Points

### Pre-Processing Flow
```
1. File Upload -> Usage Limit Check -> Allow/Block with Details
2. Transcription Start -> Usage Validation -> Reserve Credits -> Begin Processing
```

### During Processing Flow
```
1. Extract Actual Metadata -> Record Real Usage -> Continue Processing
2. Monitor Progress -> Update Usage Context -> Handle Failures
```

### Post-Processing Flow
```
1. Complete Processing -> Finalize Usage -> Update User Dashboard
2. Generate Alerts -> Provide Usage Summary -> Trigger Notifications
```

## Usage Information Structure

All API responses now include usage information in this format:

```json
{
  "usage_info": {
    "credits_used": 5,
    "credits_remaining": 25,
    "credits_total": 30,
    "estimated_cost": 0.50,
    "warnings": ["You're approaching your monthly limit"],
    "billing_period": "2024-01",
    "days_until_reset": 15,
    "is_near_limit": true,
    "is_at_limit": false,
    "concurrent_processing": 1,
    "max_concurrent": 2
  }
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### Integration Tests Created
1. **API Integration Test** (`test_api_integration.py`): Validates schema definitions, service methods, and endpoint structure
2. **Comprehensive Integration Test** (`test_transcription_usage_integration.py`): End-to-end testing with mock services

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Schema validation
- ✅ Service method availability
